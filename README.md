# Angular4 Seed

This seed project provides a boxed, front-end web-stack with a full development and production pipeline ready for [Angular](https://angular.io/) (4.x).

While not entirely comprehensive, this should provide a firm basis for a professional project. 

## Integrations

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (or JavaScript) with [linting]()
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) (or CSS) with [linting](https://postcss.org/)
- [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/) Unit Testing
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) with *testing*, *development* and *production* pipelines

## Getting Started

I've opted to move configuration files into `./configuration` so that the root is not cluttered.

If you cd into where the `package.json` file lives you can run:

- `npm run development`
- `npm run development:dashboard`
- `npm run production`
- `npm run production:dashboard`
- `npm run build:development`
- `npm run build:production`

## Improvements

Seed projects are tricky; personal and outdated the moment they are published. There are many things that can be improved in this repository, and I will do so over time.

You can track these improvements on the 'project' tab.

Please also feel free to create issues/pull-requests, which I will endeavour to look at.
